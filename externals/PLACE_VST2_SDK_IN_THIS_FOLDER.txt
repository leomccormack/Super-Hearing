Please place the VST2 SDK in this folder like so:

externals/VST2_SDK 

Which can be downloaded from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20181016150224/https://download.steinberg.net/sdk_downloads/vstsdk3610_11_06_2018_build_37.zip


The following dependencies are then included as git submodules:
externals/JUCE
externals/Spatial_Audio_Framework

If they are empty, then use the following command:
git submodule update --init --recursive
